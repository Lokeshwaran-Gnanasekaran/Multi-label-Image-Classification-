Overview
This project implements a multi-label image classifier for the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The goal is to predict the presence or absence of 20 different object classes in an image using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. The assignment is divided into two parts: pre-defined models and self-designed models.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following packages installed:
●	Python
●	numpy
●	pytorch 
●	matplotlib
●	torchvision
Running the Code:
1.Make sure you have all the required packages installed.
2. Set up the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset as described in the Data Setup section.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`CS747_Assignment2_part2.ipynb`).
4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the models and analyses.

PDF Version
For convenience, a PDF version of the notebook, which includes all outputs, has been attached. This PDF contains the executed cells and results for reference.
