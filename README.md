# Multi-Label Image Classifier for PASCAL VOC 2007  

## Overview  
This project implements a **multi-label image classifier** for the **PASCAL VOC 2007** dataset. The objective is to predict the presence or absence of **20 different object classes** in an image using **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** with **PyTorch**.  

The assignment consists of two parts:  
- **Pre-defined models**  
- **Self-designed models**  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following packages installed before running the code:  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **PyTorch**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Torchvision**  

## Running the Code  
1. Install all required dependencies.  
2. Set up the **PASCAL VOC 2007** dataset as described in the **Data Setup** section.  
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CS747_Assignment2_part2.ipynb
